    `Google Cloud IoT Core`_ allows developers to easily integrate Publish and
    Subscribe functionality with devices and programmatically manage device
    authorization.


    Before you run the sample, you must retrieve the Google root certificate.
    For example, `wget https://pki.goog/roots.pem` or
    `curl https://pki.goog/roots.pem > roots.pem`.


    The sample shows a simple but complete IoT system. The devices in this
    system publish temperature data on their telemetry feeds, and a server
    consumes the telemetry data from a Cloud Pub/Sub topic. The server then
    decides whether to turn on or off the individual devices' fans, via a
    Cloud IoT Core configuration update.


    Run the server code, followed by the device code. You should then see the
    devices publishing their temperature data, and the server instructing the
    devices to turn on and off their fans. Try running many instances of
    cloudiot_pubsub_example_mqtt_device.py at the same time, using different
    devices. If you rerun the code with the same device, the first device will
    be disconnected.


    For more information, see the the page for this sample in the
    Google Cloud IoT Core documentation:
