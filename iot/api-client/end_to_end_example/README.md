# Cloud IoT Core End-to-End example

In this example, you'll build a simple but complete IoT system. The devices in
this system publish temperature data on their telemetry feeds, and a server
consumes the telemetry data from a Cloud Pub/Sub topic. The server then decides
whether to turn on or off the individual devices' fans, via a Cloud IoT Core
configuration update.

how to run this example.
