# Cluster Status sample for Google Kubernetes Engine

This sample demonstrates how to retrieve GKE cluster statuses across multiple GCP projects. 

## Setup

Before you can run or deploy the sample, you will need to do the following:

1. If not already done, enable the Cloud Resource Manager API
   and check the quota for your project at
   https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/cloudresourcemanager
   
2. If not already done, enable the Kubernetes Engine API
   and check the quota for your project at
   https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/container
   
3. This sample uses Application Default Credentials for authentication.
   If not already done, install the gcloud CLI from
   https://cloud.google.com/sdk and run
   `gcloud beta auth application-default login`.
   For more information, see
   https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials
   
4. Install the Python client library for Google APIs by running
   `pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client

## Running locally
